MSN Messenger Blockchecker
By Naveed ur Rehman (neenojee@hotmail.com)

Hello,

First of all, thank you very much for downloading my project. I think the codes are too simple and one can easily understand if he know simple winsock programming. Well, explaining my server working here, i mean how can u surf it - Just the two steps:

1- Tell your friends/users (or display it on your website or where ever you like) that if they want to check their blocklists then they should change their MSN Messenger Connection settings as follow:

	I want to use proxy (check it on)
	Proxy type: SOCK Version 4
	Server=localhost or your IP/hsot name.
	Port=20801

Now, as you might want to first test it on your self then, its simple, just open your own messenger and do these settings.

2- Settings are done. Now simply sign in with your account in MSN messenger and wait until it sings out automatically. Just after a few seconds, you will get an email which will contain your blocklist. One more thing as you are running server application on your own computer, you can check the blocklist in server's main (frmMain.frm).

I think these explanations are enough. Go check it - and don't worry, I know that I have made it not very much flexible (as it always connects to SMTP's port 25, always send email from account neenojee@hotmail.com etc) but you can change it easily. Lets edit it in your own way. Please don't comment on this unflexibility of my codes. I made it for my own use but I always release my codes, thats why I share as-same-as-it-is on planet-source-code.com

Do write comments, how much you like it, need any thing more and what ever, even bug reports etc. I like to hear !!!

Vote for me !!!
