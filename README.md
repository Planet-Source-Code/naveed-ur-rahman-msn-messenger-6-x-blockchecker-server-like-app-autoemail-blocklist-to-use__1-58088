### Description

Lets easily impress your friends or raise up the traffic at your site !!! I think, the title is enough to explain my project. Well, just a few more things to say that ... I have tested it with MSN 6.x and I got 100% results. This application works as a server on your computer. The project needs no more code updating, just compile it, put it on your server machine and run it ! Even just run it for a few minutes and provide services to your friends (Even if you are using a lazy internet service like me - ewww) Readme included.

SMTP servers are also given so don't worry about this. Oh yeh, send comments and don't forget to VOTE ME.
